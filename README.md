# ArtSpaceApp
I made this Art Space app using the Jetpack Compose and Compose clickable buttons.
Making this app included learning  about: 

• when loop in Kotlin to make changes in the images and text display.\
• Surface element to make the elevated boxes and making the UI more interesting.\
• Button to interact with user.\
• Box element to make the image and text in a box which enchances UI experience.
